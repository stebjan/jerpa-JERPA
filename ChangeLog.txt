       CHANGED: JERPALang - extended of actionAnalyse texts in ededb,
       ADDED:   JERPA - ActionAnalyseSelected - selected file in Signal Perspective - not entirely done - really don't know how to "switch" perspectives after file is loaded (maybe making public mainMenu getter in JUIGLE, finding proper item and doing doClick? It would demand editing of JUIGLE).
       CHANGED: JERPA - in SignalPerspective method openFile (created from piece of existing code) made public (it's used in ActionAnalyseSelected).
       
       BUG REPORT: above folder where is JERPA run I observe creating tmp files in case of analysing files - these files do not delete by itself.
